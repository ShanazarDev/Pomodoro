 # Usage
  
  Run main.py file. 
  
If you want to change the timer, change the number 25 to any other, the main point 25 is minutes, which means that the number that you insert there will already be in minutes!
  
```python
min_25 = 60 * 25  # 25 minutes 
```
In the same way you can change the minutes of break time.

```python
min_5 = 60 * 5 # 5 minutes break 
min_10 = 60 * 10 # 10 minutes break
min_15 = 60 * 15 # 15 minutes break
```
